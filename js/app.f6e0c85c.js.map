Он устанавливается в местах, где дорога очень узкая, как у нас – тонкий мостик, где две машины одновременно не разъедутся. Наш знак запрещает нам двигаться первыми и заставляет дождаться, пока машины встречного направления проедут по узкому участку дороги. На знаке нарисована длинная черная полоска по направлению грузовика, он едет первым. У нас маленькая и красная – мы стоим.
